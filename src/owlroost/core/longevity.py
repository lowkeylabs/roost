Gompertz–Makeham-based longevity model for ROOST / OWL.

This module provides a conservative, actuarially interpretable longevity
model suitable for retirement planning and Monte Carlo simulation.

Features:
- Three-tier health adjustments ("excellent", "average", "poor")
- Sex-based mortality differences
- Age-dependent smoker mortality multiplier
- Partnered longevity bonus (cohabiting relationship effect)
- Individual lifetime sampling
- Joint (last-survivor) lifetime sampling
- Integer-age stochastic sampling aligned with annual planning timelines

Design goals:
- Preserve actuarial intuition (Gompertz–Makeham hazard structure)
- Produce realistic but conservative longevity outcomes
- Avoid extreme upper-tail dominance (ages 110–120)
- Ensure relative longevity differences persist at advanced ages
- Maintain stability across Monte Carlo runs

Modeling notes:
- Baseline mortality follows a Gompertz–Makeham form calibrated to
  approximate SSA population mortality for ages 55+
- Health, sex, smoking, and partnered status primarily scale baseline
  mortality (A, B)
- Health also applies a small adjustment to mortality acceleration (C)
  so that health advantages are not erased at older ages
- "Partnered" reflects a stable long-term cohabiting relationship
  associated with modest mortality reduction (not strictly legal marriage)
- This is not a strict SSA or ALI table reproduction, but a smooth,
  planning-oriented hybrid model

# ============================================================

# Notes:
# - These primarily scale baseline mortality (A, B)
# - A small additional adjustment to mortality acceleration (C)
#   is applied separately to preserve health differences at older ages
#
# Reference ranges:
#   ALI / preferred-risk models often imply stronger effects
#   (excellent ≈ 0.75, poor ≈ 1.40–1.50). These values are intentionally
#   more conservative to avoid extreme longevity shifts.

# ============================================================
# Health adjustment to mortality acceleration (C)
# ============================================================

# Rationale:
# In a Gompertz model, differences in baseline mortality (A, B)
# diminish at advanced ages unless mortality acceleration also differs.
# A small, damped adjustment to C ensures that health advantages persist
# into late life without reintroducing extreme upper-tail outcomes.

# Sex multipliers
# ============================================================

# Notes:
# - Females receive a modest mortality reduction consistent with
#   observed SSA population differences at adult ages
# - Males receive a symmetric increase
# - Effects are intentionally weaker than full qₓ table substitution

# Partnered longevity bonus
# ============================================================

# "Partnered" represents a stable, long-term cohabiting relationship.
# Research consistently shows that individuals in stable partnered
# relationships exhibit modestly lower mortality relative to those
# living alone. This effect is modeled as a small multiplicative
# reduction in baseline hazard (A, B).
#
# This is not intended to model legal marital status specifically,
# but rather the protective effect of cohabitation and shared support.

# Age-dependent smoker multiplier

# Shape reflects ALI / SOA guidance:
# - strong excess mortality at ages 40–65
# - tapering effect at older ages
# - small residual effect at very advanced ages
#
# Maximum effects are intentionally capped to remain conservative.
